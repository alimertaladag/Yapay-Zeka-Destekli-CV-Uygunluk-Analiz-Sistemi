AI-Powered CV Suitability Analysis System
This project is a simple, Python-based web application that analyzes a CV's (Curriculum Vitae) suitability for a specific job posting, considering both content and structural organization. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for keyword matching and incorporates a simple rule-based mechanism to score the CV's overall visual/structural quality (simulating image processing).
ðŸŒŸ Features
Dynamic Job Posting Analysis: Evaluates the CV against a job description entered by the user.
Content Suitability: Calculates a keyword matching score using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.
Structural Quality Simulation: Scores the CV based on criteria like length and the presence of core sections (Experience, Education, Skills, etc.)â€”a simulation of basic visual analysis.
Simple Frontend: Stable, Flask-based user interface that avoids complex Jinja2 templating.
